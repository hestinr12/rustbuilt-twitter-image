rustbuilt-twitter-image
=======================

A simple script to receive twitter profile pictures for the RustBuilt home page


To use, run with:


     python twitpic.py <number of blank pictures>



The number of blank pictures can be calculated by count the whiteboxes from the top most row, left to right, until a square with a picture filled in is reached. White blocks after this point should not be counted (these occur due to incorrect handle entry).
